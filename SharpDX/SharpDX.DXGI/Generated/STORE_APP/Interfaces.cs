These memory allocations count against the app's memory usage for PLM  and in general lead to increased memory usage by the overall system.</p><p>Starting in Windows?8.1, apps that render with Direct2D and/or Direct3D (including <strong>CoreWindow</strong> and XAML interop) must call <strong>Trim</strong> in response to the PLM suspend callback. The Direct3D runtime and the graphics driver will discard internal memory buffers allocated for the app, reducing its memory footprint.</p><p>Calling this method does not change the rendering state of the graphics device and it has no effect on rendering operations. There is a brief performance hit when internal buffers are reallocated during the first rendering operations after the <strong>Trim</strong> call, therefore apps should only call <strong>Trim</strong> when going idle for a period of time (in response to PLM suspend, for example).</p><p>Apps should ensure that they call <strong>Trim</strong> as one of the last D3D operations done before going idle. Direct3D will normally defer the destruction of D3D objects. Calling <strong>Trim</strong>, however, forces Direct3D to destroy objects immediately. For this reason, it is not guaranteed that releasing the final reference on Direct3D objects after calling <strong>Trim</strong> will cause the object to be destroyed and memory to be deallocated  before the app suspends.</p><p>Similar to <strong>ID3D11DeviceContext::Flush</strong>, apps should call <strong>ID3D11DeviceContext::ClearState</strong> before calling <strong>Trim</strong>. <strong>ClearState</strong> clears the Direct3D pipeline bindings, ensuring that Direct3D does not hold any references to the Direct3D objects you are trying to release.</p><p>It is also prudent to release references on middleware before calling <strong>Trim</strong>, as that middleware may also need to release references

For example, on a WM_SIZE message, the application should release any outstanding swap-chain back buffers, call <strong>IDXGISwapChain::ResizeBuffers</strong>, then re-acquire the back buffers from the swap chain(s). This gives the swap chain(s) an opportunity to resize the back buffers, and/or recreate them to enable full-screen flipping operation. If the application does not perform this sequence, DXGI will still make the full-screen/windowed transition, but may be forced to use a stretch operation (since the back buffers may not be the correct size), which may be less efficient. Even if a stretch is not required, presentation may not be optimal because the back buffers might not be directly interchangeable with the front buffer. Thus, a call to <strong>ResizeBuffers</strong> on WM_SIZE is always recommended, since WM_SIZE is always sent during a fullscreen transition.</p><p>While windowed, the application can, if it chooses, restrict the size of its window's client area to sizes to which it is comfortable rendering. A fully flexible application would make no such restriction, but UI elements or other design considerations can, of course, make this flexibility untenable. If the application further chooses to restrict its window's client area to just those that match supported full-screen resolutions, the application can field WM_SIZING, then check against <strong>IDXGIOutput::FindClosestMatchingMode</strong>. If a matching mode is found, allow the resize. (The <see cref = "SharpDX.DXGI.Output"/> can be retrieved from <strong>IDXGISwapChain::GetContainingOutput</strong>. Absent subsequent changes to desktop topology, this will be the same output that will be chosen when alt-enter is fielded and fullscreen mode is begun for that swap chain.)</p><p>Applications that want to handle mode changes or Alt+Enter themselves should call <strong>MakeWindowAssociation</strong> with the DXGI_MWA_NO_WINDOW_CHANGES flag after swap chain creation. The <em>WindowHandle</em> argument, if non-<strong><c>null</c></strong>, specifies that the application message queues will not be handled by the DXGI runtime for all swap chains of a particular target <strong><see cref = "System.IntPtr"/></strong>.  Calling <strong>MakeWindowAssociation</strong> with the DXGI_MWA_NO_WINDOW_CHANGES flag after swapchain creation ensures that DXGI will not interfere with application's handling of window mode changes or Alt+Enter.</p>

This can reduce presentation performance if the swap chain size and the output window size do not match. Here are two ways to ensure that the sizes match:</p><ul> <li>Create a windowed swap chain and then set it full-screen using <strong>IDXGISwapChain::SetFullscreenState</strong>.</li> <li>Save a reference to the swap chain immediately after creation, and use it to get the output window size during a WM_SIZE event. Then resize the swap chain buffers (with <strong>IDXGISwapChain::ResizeBuffers</strong>) during the transition from windowed to full-screen.</li> </ul><p>If the swap chain is in full-screen mode, before you release it you must use <strong>SetFullscreenState</strong> to switch it to windowed mode. For more information about releasing a swap chain, see the "Destroying a Swap Chain" section of DXGI Overview.</p><p>After the runtime renders the initial frame in full screen, the runtime might unexpectedly exit full screen during a call to <strong>IDXGISwapChain::Present</strong>. To work around this issue, we recommend that you execute the following code right after you call <strong>CreateSwapChain</strong> to create a full-screen swap chain (<strong>Windowed</strong> member of <strong><see cref = "SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription"/></strong> set to <strong><see cref = "SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong>).
